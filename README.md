**Learning Objective:** Use display:flex on two elements, and then add additional CSS properties to achieve a desired layout.

***
Use Flexbox to achieve this layout. You don't need to add the border. It's been added in this example to highlight the alignment and spacing you're shooting for.

## UI/UX Challenge
This is an optional challenge once you meet MVP. Make a new Github branch for this challenge.

- Creating visual hierarchies
    1. Add an address, phone number, and website link to each coffee house (you may use mocked data)
    2. Using semantic HTML and CSS, style each coffee house component with the goals of easy scannability. At a minimum, you will emphasize the name of each shop and make the website link clearly clickable.
    Background color - if you add a background color/image, ensure the copy (text color) has good contrast and is legible.
